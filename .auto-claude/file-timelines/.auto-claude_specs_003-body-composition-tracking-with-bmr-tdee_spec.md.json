        "content": "# Body Composition Tracking with BMR/TDEE\n\nComplete body composition logging system including height, weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, with automatic BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor) and TDEE calculations. Visualize changes over time with Swift Charts graphs showing trends and goal progress.\n\n## Rationale\nCore differentiator: unified body composition + metabolic tracking that competitors lack. Addresses user pain point of 'hard to see correlations between body composition changes and lifestyle factors'. Better than InBody's unreliable app with 3-22% body fat variation complaints.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a fitness enthusiast, I want to track my body fat and muscle mass changes so that I can see my progress\n- As a dieter, I want to know my BMR/TDEE so that I can plan my calorie intake accurately\n- As a goal-oriented user, I want to visualize my body composition trends so that I stay motivated\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can input height, weight, body fat %, muscle mass with validation\n- [ ] BMR calculated automatically using Mifflin-St Jeor formula\n- [ ] TDEE calculated based on activity level multiplier\n- [ ] MetabolismSnapshot saved with each body record for historical tracking\n- [ ] Swift Charts displays weight/body fat trends over 7/30/90 days\n- [ ] Dashboard shows current BMR/TDEE alongside daily intake/expenditure\n- [ ] Performance: queries complete in under 0.5 seconds\n",
