  - checkShouldShow(): Validates time (02:00+) and checks for existing records
  - incrementSkipCount(): Increments daily skip count
  - resetSkipCount(): Resets count when record is saved
  - cleanupOldSkipCounts(): Removes data older than 7 days
- Dependency injection for SleepRepository and UserDefaults
- Comprehensive Korean documentation (440 lines)

**Files Created:**
- Bodii/Presentation/Features/Sleep/SleepPromptManager.swift

**Next Steps:**
- Task 3.6: Add SleepViewModel factory to DIContainer
- Phase 5: Integrate sleep prompt into app launch (BodiiApp.swift)

### Task: Main container view for sleep feature with navigation to history/trends

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `SleepTabView.swift` following container view pattern
- Main container for sleep feature with segmented control navigation
- Key Features:
  * Segmented Picker for tab selection:
    - "기록" (History) tab
    - "트렌드" (Trends) tab
  * NavigationStack wrapper (top-level only)
  * Toolbar add button for manual sleep input (accessible from all tabs)
  * Lazy ViewModel initialization for performance
  * Extracted content views to avoid NavigationStack nesting:
    - SleepHistoryContentView (history list without NavigationStack)
    - SleepTrendsContentView (trends chart without NavigationStack)
  * Sheet presentation for SleepInputSheet
  * DIContainer dependency injection
- Architecture Pattern:
  * Parent provides NavigationStack
  * Child content views provide only content (no NavigationStack)
  * Prevents NavigationStack nesting issues
  * Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive Korean documentation (1400+ lines)
- Ready for integration into main ContentView (task 5.4)

**Files Created:**
- Bodii/Presentation/Features/Sleep/SleepTabView.swift

**UI/UX Highlights:**
- Clean segmented control for intuitive tab switching
- Consistent toolbar add button across all tabs
- Smooth transitions between History and Trends views
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Follows iOS design patterns and conventions

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Single NavigationStack at top level
- Content extraction pattern for reusability
- Avoids nested NavigationStack issues
- Independent ViewModel lifecycle per tab
- Memory efficient with lazy initialization

**Next Steps:**
- Task 5.2: Integrate sleep prompt into app launch (BodiiApp.swift)
- Task 5.3: Add sleep status to DashboardView
- Task 5.4: Add Sleep tab to main navigation (ContentView.swift)
