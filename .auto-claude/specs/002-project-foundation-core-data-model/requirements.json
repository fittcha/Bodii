  "task_description": "# Project Foundation & Core Data Model\n\nSet up Xcode project with SwiftUI, MVVM architecture, Core Data persistence layer with 9 entities (User, BodyRecord, MetabolismSnapshot, Food, FoodRecord, ExerciseRecord, SleepRecord, DailyLog, Goal), and utility services for date handling and input validation.\n\n## Rationale\nEssential infrastructure for all other features. Core Data provides reliable local storage addressing competitor pain points of app crashes and data loss (InBody, Noom, MyFitnessPal data corruption incidents). Local-first approach ensures privacy and reliability.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want a well-structured project so that I can build features efficiently\n- As a user, I want my data stored locally so that it's always available even offline\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Xcode project created with iOS 17+ target and SwiftUI lifecycle\n- [ ] Core Data model implements all 9 entities from ERD\n- [ ] MVVM folder structure established (Views, ViewModels, Models, Services, Utils)\n- [ ] PersistenceController manages Core Data stack with save/fetch operations\n- [ ] DateUtils handles 02:00 sleep boundary logic correctly\n- [ ] ValidationService validates all input ranges (height 100-250cm, weight 20-300kg, etc.)\n",
