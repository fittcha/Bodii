## Subtask 1.7: Define GoalType enum for user goals

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
The GoalType enum was already implemented and committed (commit 3fab35a). Verified the implementation meets all acceptance criteria and updated the implementation plan to reflect completion status.

### Implementation Details
- **File**: `Bodii/Shared/Enums/GoalType.swift`
- **Enum Type**: `Int16` rawValue for Core Data compatibility
- **Cases**:
  - `lose = 0` - 감량 (Weight Loss)
  - `maintain = 1` - 유지 (Maintain)
  - `gain = 2` - 증량 (Weight Gain)
- **Protocols**: CaseIterable, Codable, Identifiable
- **Display Names**: Korean localized strings via `displayName` property

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
✅ GoalType enum with rawValue Int16
✅ Cases: lose (0), maintain (1), gain (2)
✅ Korean localized display names
✅ Follows project patterns (same structure as Gender, MealType, FoodSource)
✅ Identifiable extension using rawValue as id
✅ CaseIterable and Codable conformance
