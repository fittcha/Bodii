## Subtask 2.3: Create Date+Extensions - ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** COMPLETED (Previously implemented in commit 96c7cc6)
**File:** Bodii/Shared/Extensions/Date+Extensions.swift

### Implementation Details

All acceptance criteria have been met:

✅ **startOfDay computed property**
   - Returns the start of day (00:00:00) for the date
   - Delegates to DateUtils.startOfDay(for:)

✅ **endOfDay computed property**
   - Returns the end of day (23:59:59) for the date
   - Delegates to DateUtils.endOfDay(for:)

✅ **age(from birthDate:) static method**
   - Calculates age from birth date to reference date (default: now)
   - Delegates to DateUtils.age(from:referenceDate:)

✅ **isSameDay(as:) comparison method**
   - Compares if two dates are on the same day
   - Delegates to DateUtils.isSameDay(_:_:)

✅ **isToday computed property**
   - Checks if the date is today
   - Delegates to DateUtils.isToday(_:)

✅ **daysBetween(and:) method**
   - Calculates the number of days between two dates
   - Delegates to DateUtils.daysBetween(_:and:)

✅ **formatted(style:) for Korean date formatting**
   - Formats dates using FormatStyle enum
   - Supports: .full, .short, .withWeekday, .time, .dateTime
   - Delegates to DateUtils.format(_:format:)

### Quality Attributes

✅ Follows established patterns (Korean docs, learning notes, MARK comments)
✅ No console.log/print debugging statements
✅ Comprehensive documentation with examples
✅ Type-safe API with FormatStyle enum
✅ Proper delegation to DateUtils for implementation
✅ Already committed with descriptive message

### Git Status

- File committed in: 96c7cc6
- Commit message: "auto-claude: 2.3 - Convenience extensions for Date type"
- Working tree: clean

### Notes

This subtask was already completed in a previous session. The implementation provides convenient instance methods and computed properties that delegate to DateUtils, offering a more natural Swift API (e.g., `date.startOfDay` instead of `DateUtils.startOfDay(for: date)`).

The implementation includes a bonus FormatStyle enum for type-safe date formatting with Korean locale support.
