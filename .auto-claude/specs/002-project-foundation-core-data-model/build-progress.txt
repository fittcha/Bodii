## Subtask 2.3: Create Date+Extensions

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
The Date+Extensions file was already fully implemented and committed (commit 96c7cc6). Verified the implementation meets all acceptance criteria and updated the implementation plan to reflect completion status.

### Implementation Details
- **File**: `Bodii/Shared/Extensions/Date+Extensions.swift`
- **Purpose**: Provides convenient instance methods and computed properties for Date type
- **Pattern**: Extensions delegate to DateUtils for actual implementation, providing cleaner API
- **Key Features**:
  - Computed properties for natural syntax (`date.startOfDay` vs `DateUtils.startOfDay(for: date)`)
  - Instance methods for better readability (`date1.isSameDay(as: date2)`)
  - Static methods for age calculation
  - Type-safe FormatStyle enum for date formatting

### Implemented Methods
✅ **startOfDay** - Computed property returning 00:00:00 of the date
✅ **endOfDay** - Computed property returning 23:59:59 of the date
✅ **isSameDay(as:)** - Instance method comparing if two dates are the same day
✅ **isToday** - Computed property checking if date is today
✅ **daysBetween(and:)** - Instance method calculating days between dates
✅ **age(from:referenceDate:)** - Static method calculating age from birth date
✅ **formatted(style:)** - Instance method for Korean locale date formatting

### FormatStyle Enum
The implementation includes a nested FormatStyle enum for type-safe formatting:
- **full**: "yyyy년 MM월 dd일" (e.g., "2024년 01월 15일")
- **short**: "M월 d일" (e.g., "1월 15일")
- **withWeekday**: "M월 d일 (E)" (e.g., "1월 15일 (월)")
- **time**: "HH:mm" (e.g., "14:30")
- **dateTime**: "M월 d일 HH:mm" (e.g., "1월 15일 14:30")

### Examples
```swift
let today = Date()
let dayStart = today.startOfDay // 오늘 00:00:00
let dayEnd = today.endOfDay // 오늘 23:59:59
let isSame = today.isSameDay(as: otherDate) // Boolean comparison
let age = Date.age(from: birthDate) // Calculate age from birth date
let formatted = today.formatted(style: .full) // "2024년 01월 15일"
```

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
✅ startOfDay computed property
✅ endOfDay computed property
✅ age(from birthDate:) static method for calculating age
✅ isSameDay(as:) comparison method
✅ isToday computed property
✅ daysBetween(and:) method
✅ formatted(style:) for Korean date formatting
✅ Follows project patterns (Korean docs, learning points, Java/Kotlin comparisons)
✅ Comprehensive documentation with examples

### Commits
- 96c7cc6: auto-claude: 2.3 - Convenience extensions for Date type

### Next Steps
**Phase 2 (Utility Services)** - Progress: 3/5 completed (60%)
- 2.1: Create DateUtils ✅ COMPLETED
- 2.2: Create ValidationService ✅ COMPLETED
- 2.3: Create Date+Extensions ✅ COMPLETED
- 2.4: Create Decimal+Extensions ⏳ PENDING
- 2.5: Create Formatters Utility ⏳ PENDING

### Notes
The Date+Extensions provides a more SwiftUI-friendly API by adding instance methods and computed properties to the Date type. All methods delegate to DateUtils for consistency and maintainability. This pattern is common in Swift - having both utility classes and convenience extensions.

The FormatStyle enum provides type-safe date formatting, preventing string-based format errors and making code more readable.
