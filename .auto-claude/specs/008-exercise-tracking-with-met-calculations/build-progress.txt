## Build Progress: Exercise Tracking with MET Calculations

### Phase 1: Core Services & Data Layer (COMPLETED)
✅ 1.1 - ExerciseCalcService for MET-based calorie calculation
✅ 1.2 - ExerciseRecordRepository protocol
✅ 1.3 - ExerciseRecordLocalDataSource
✅ 1.4 - ExerciseRecordRepositoryImpl
✅ 1.5 - DailyLogService for exercise updates

### Phase 2: Use Cases & Business Logic (COMPLETED)
✅ 2.1 - AddExerciseRecordUseCase (Verified and marked complete - 2026-01-14)
    - Validates exercise duration (minimum 1 minute)
    - Calculates calories using ExerciseCalcService with MET formula
    - Saves ExerciseRecord via exerciseRepository
    - Updates DailyLog via dailyLogService
    - Comprehensive documentation and error handling
    - Implementation committed in 5cd3957

✅ 2.2 - UpdateExerciseRecordUseCase (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Fetches existing ExerciseRecord by ID and validates ownership
    - Recalculates calories when type, duration, or intensity changes
    - Updates ExerciseRecord via repository
    - Adjusts DailyLog with difference calculation (updateExercise method)
    - Comprehensive error handling (RecordNotFoundError, UnauthorizedError, ValidationError)
    - Implementation committed in 7119ae7

✅ 2.3 - DeleteExerciseRecordUseCase (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Fetches existing ExerciseRecord by ID and validates ownership
    - Updates DailyLog via dailyLogService.removeExercise() before deletion
    - Deletes ExerciseRecord via exerciseRepository.delete()
    - Decrements totalCaloriesOut, exerciseMinutes, and exerciseCount in DailyLog
    - Comprehensive error handling (RecordNotFoundError, UnauthorizedError)
    - Implementation committed in c19fdab

✅ 2.4 - GetExerciseRecordsUseCase (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Fetches records for a specific date
    - Fetches records for a date range
    - Returns sorted by date (newest first)
    - Simple read UseCase pattern
    - Implementation committed in 37da4fe

### Phase 3: UI - Exercise List View (IN PROGRESS)
✅ 3.1 - ExerciseListViewModel (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Manages state for exercise records, daily summary, loading, and errors
    - Fetches data using GetExerciseRecordsUseCase and DailyLogRepository
    - Date navigation support (previous/next day, date selection)
    - Concurrent data fetching with async/await for optimal performance
    - @MainActor annotations for UI-safe updates
    - Comprehensive documentation with Korean learning comments
    - Implementation committed in 0ed5cca

✅ 3.2 - ExerciseCardView component (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Displays exercise type icon and name using SF Symbols
    - Shows duration, intensity badge, and calories burned
    - Color-coded intensity badges (green/orange/red)
    - Unique accent colors per exercise type
    - Swipe-to-delete gesture support
    - Reusable component with clean design
    - Implementation committed in 5403d2a

✅ 3.3 - ExerciseListView (Completed - 2026-01-14)
    - Date navigation header with previous/next day buttons
    - Daily summary section with color-coded cards (calories, time, count)
    - Exercise list using ExerciseCardView components
    - Empty state with helpful messaging and add button
    - Pull-to-refresh support using refreshable modifier
    - Loading state with progress indicator
    - Error handling with alert dialog
    - Multiple preview configurations for development
    - Implementation committed in 2dc33bc

⏳ 3.4 - DailySummaryCardView for exercises (PENDING - NOTE: Summary integrated into ExerciseListView)

### Phase 4: UI - Exercise Input Modal (PENDING)
⏳ 4.1 - ExerciseInputViewModel
⏳ 4.2 - ExerciseTypeGridView component
⏳ 4.3 - IntensityPickerView component
⏳ 4.4 - DurationInputView component
⏳ 4.5 - ExerciseInputView modal

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (PENDING)
⏳ 5.1 - Register exercise services in DIContainer
⏳ 5.2 - Integrate ExerciseListView into TabView
⏳ 5.3 - Write unit tests for ExerciseCalcService
⏳ 5.4 - Write unit tests for DailyLog exercise updates
⏳ 5.5 - Add exercise validation to ValidationService
