# Exercise Tracking with MET Calculations - Build Progress

## Status: Planning Complete
Created: 2026-01-13

## Summary
Implementation plan created with 5 phases and 16 subtasks.
Total estimated time: ~10 hours

## Phases Overview
1. Phase 1: Core Services Layer (5 subtasks)
   - ExerciseCalcService, Repositories, ExerciseRecordService

2. Phase 2: UI Layer (7 subtasks)
   - ViewModels, Views, Components

3. Phase 3: Integration and Navigation (2 subtasks)
   - DIContainer, TabView integration

4. Phase 4: Testing (2 subtasks)
   - Unit tests for calc service and enum

5. Phase 5: Custom Exercise Support (1 subtask)
   - Enhanced 'Other' exercise type with custom MET

## Current Progress
- [x] Read spec and project documentation
- [x] Analyzed existing codebase structure
- [x] Created implementation_plan.json
- [x] Phase 1: Core Services Layer (5/5 completed)
- [x] Phase 2: UI Layer (7/7 completed)
- [ ] Phase 3: Integration and Navigation
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Phase 5: Custom Exercise Support

## Key Decisions
1. Using existing ExerciseType.baseMET and metValue(for:) for MET calculations
2. Repositories pattern for Core Data access
3. Service layer handles DailyLog cascade updates
4. Custom MET stored in note field as JSON for 'Other' exercise type

## Dependencies Identified
- Existing: ExerciseRecord, DailyLog, User domain entities
- Existing: ExerciseType, Intensity enums with MET data
- Existing: PersistenceController for Core Data
- Need to create: Repositories, Services, ViewModels, Views

    - Validates duration >= 1 minute
    - Fetches old ExerciseRecord
    - Calculates new calories
    - Updates ExerciseRecord
    - Handles same date: adjusts delta in same DailyLog
    - Handles date change: removes from old DailyLog, adds to new DailyLog
  * deleteExercise(): Removes record and decrements DailyLog values
    - Fetches ExerciseRecord
    - Updates DailyLog: totalCaloriesOut -= calories, exerciseMinutes -= duration, exerciseCount -= 1
    - Deletes ExerciseRecord
  * fetchExercises(for:on:): Returns exercises for a specific date
