  "task_description": "# Apple HealthKit Integration\n\nBidirectional sync with Apple HealthKit for weight, body fat, active calories, sleep, and workout data. Read existing data and write Bodii records to maintain ecosystem connectivity.\n\n## Rationale\nEssential for iOS health app ecosystem. Users expect Apple Health integration. Differentiator vs. cross-platform apps that have limited HealthKit support. Native SwiftUI provides optimal integration quality that Flutter/React Native can't match.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an Apple Watch user, I want my workout data to sync to Bodii automatically\n- As a user, I want my Bodii data in Apple Health so that my doctors can see it\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] HealthKit entitlements properly configured\n- [ ] Permission request explains all data types needed\n- [ ] Read weight, body fat, active calories from HealthKit\n- [ ] Write Bodii records to HealthKit (weight, workouts, sleep)\n- [ ] Background sync when app is closed\n- [ ] Conflict resolution for duplicate entries\n- [ ] Graceful handling when user denies permissions\n",
