  "description": "# Unified Daily Dashboard\n\nCentral dashboard showing all daily health metrics: calorie balance (intake vs. TDEE), macro breakdown, exercise summary, sleep quality, and body composition status. Pre-calculated values for fast loading.\n\n## Rationale\nKey differentiator: all-in-one view that competitors don't provide. Users currently need 3-4 apps. Pre-calculated DailyLog entity ensures sub-0.5s performance, directly addressing MyFitnessPal's lag complaints and Lose It's freezing issues. Clean SwiftUI native interface unlike InBody's clunky app.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want one screen showing all my health data so that I have a complete picture\n- As a busy person, I want fast app loading so that tracking doesn't waste my time\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Dashboard loads in under 0.5 seconds with pre-calculated values\n- [ ] Shows today's calorie intake vs. TDEE with visual indicator\n- [ ] Displays macro breakdown (protein/carbs/fat) with progress bars\n- [ ] Shows exercise calories burned for the day\n- [ ] Displays previous night's sleep duration and quality\n- [ ] Quick-add buttons for food, exercise, and body composition\n- [ ] Date navigation to view past days\n- [ ] Pull-to-refresh updates all metrics\n",
