Tests cover: loadDailyLog success/failure scenarios, date navigation (previous/next/today/selectDate), refresh behavior, state transitions (loading → success/error), computed properties, date formatting (오늘/어제/formatted date), error handling and clearError. Created MockDailyLogRepository for dependency isolation. All tests follow Given-When-Then pattern with @MainActor for proper async/await testing. Committed as: 7972b20",
