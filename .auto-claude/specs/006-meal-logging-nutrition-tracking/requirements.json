  "task_description": "# Meal Logging & Nutrition Tracking\n\nFull diet tracking with meal categorization (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), food search, manual entry, serving size adjustment, and daily calorie/macro summary. Support flexible meal slots without arbitrary limitations.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses core user pain point of 'manual calorie and macro tracking is tedious'. Unlike YAZIO's 4-meal limitation, Bodii offers flexibility. Consistent UI avoids Noom's confusing calorie display issues.
