# Meal Logging & Nutrition Tracking

Full diet tracking with meal categorization (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), food search, manual entry, serving size adjustment, and daily calorie/macro summary. Support flexible meal slots without arbitrary limitations.

## Rationale
Addresses core user pain point of 'manual calorie and macro tracking is tedious'. Unlike YAZIO's 4-meal limitation, Bodii offers flexibility. Consistent UI avoids Noom's confusing calorie display issues. Shows transparent macro breakdown addressing Lose It's UI regression complaints.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to quickly log my meals so that tracking doesn't interrupt my day
- As a dieter, I want to see my daily macro breakdown so that I can balance my nutrition
